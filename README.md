# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors - Python Terminal Game  

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  
This is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built in **Python** that runs entirely in the terminal. The game allows a user to play against the computer, making choices between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**. The winner is determined based on traditional game rules, and the player can continue playing until they decide to quit.

This project is designed for **beginner programmers** to learn fundamental programming concepts, especially those transitioning from JavaScript to Python.

## 📚 **Topics Covered**
This project introduces and reinforces the following **Python programming concepts**:

- **User Input** (`input()`)  
- **Random Module** (`random.choice()`)  
- **Lists** (Similar to JavaScript arrays)  
- **Functions** (Defining and calling functions)  
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- **Loops** (`while True`)  
- **String Methods** (`.lower()` to normalize input)  

This project also helps students see the similarities between **Python** and **JavaScript**.
